# Windows LAPS Management

Windows LAPS offers multiple ways to manage the solution. This article provides a brief overview of some of the management mechanisms.

## Overview

There's a large number of configuration settings that be configured via both a Group Policy setting and an Intune Configuration Service Provider (CSP):
