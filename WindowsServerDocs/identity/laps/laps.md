## Overview

Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is a Windows feature that automatically manages and backs up the password of a local administrator account on your Azure Active Directory-joined and Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices. The feature can also be used to automatically manage and back up the Directory Services Repair Mode account password on your Windows Server Active Directory domain controllers. Having the password backed up this way provides many security and functionality benefits.
